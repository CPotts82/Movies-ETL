# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
The company, Amazing Prime would like to develop an algorithm to see which low budget movies will be popular and buy the movie rights to them. In order to create the algorithm to see which movies will prove to be popular, Amazing Prime is sponsoring a hack-athon so participants can help predict popular movies. To prepare for the hack-athon, data had to be extracted from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens in order to be transformed/cleaned and then loaded into a SQL database for ease of storing and analyzing. After the data was extracted, it was filtered to remove bad data and the existing data was cleaned up and formatted uniformly. Finally, after the data was cleaned it was loaded into a SQL database. The primary objective was to create a function/data pipleline  that would read in all new data, transform/clean it and finally load into SQL tables. This function/pipeline was created to extract, transform and load new data on a daily basis.
