# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
Amazing Prime would like to develop an algorithm to see which low budget movies will be popular and buy the movie rights at low cost.  In order to create the algorithm to see which movies will prove to be popular, Amazing Prime is sponsoring a hack-a-thon so participants can help predict popular movies. To prepare for the hack-athon, data had to be extracted from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens in order to be transformed/cleaned and then loaded into a SQL database for ease of storing and analyzing. After the data was extracted it was filtered to remove bad data and the existing data was cleaned up and formatted uniformly. Finally after the data was cleaned it was loaded into a SQL database.
